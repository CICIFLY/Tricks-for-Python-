# Are you having troubles to install one of the popular libraries manully? 
# Or do you think it's too time consuming to install them separately?
# I recently found a way to install "Jupyter notebook, matplotlib, numpy,scipy,scikit-learn,tensorflow" on one command line.
# And it works on Linux , Windows 10 and Virtual environment too.

First, setup :  you need to have python 3 and pip3 installed 

Here is the code:
pip3 install --upgrade jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn tensorflow 

Hope it helps!
