# Are you having troubles to install one of the popular libraries manully? 
# Or do you think it's too time consuming to install them separately?
# I recently found a way to install "Jupyter notebook, matplotlib, numpy,scipy,scikit-learn,tensorflow" on one command line.
# And it works on Linux , Windows 10 and Virtual environment too.

1. setup :  you need to have python 3 and pip3 installed 
   (1).how to install pip3 on ubuntu ? 
       sudo apt-get update  # update first 
       sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip

   (2) If first did not work then you can also do this using curl
        curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
  
2. python3 get-pip.py --user
3. pip3 --help            # verify installation 
4. pip3 --version   # For checking version :


5. Here is the magic code:
   pip3 install --upgrade jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn tensorflow 

Addition notes:
When I run my codes , it shows "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" after running import tensorflow.
It happens because your computer CPU requires an earlier tensorflow version . So degrade your version . 

(1) uninstall your tensorflow first by command 
    pip3 uninstall tensorflow 

(2) install tensorflow with earlier version by command 
    pip3 install tensorflow==1.5.0
 
 if error like this occurs in step 2 "Cannot uninstall 'html5lib'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately...." 
 then install html5lib package before you install the earlier version.
  
 install html5lib by command : 
   conda install -c anaconda html5lib 
    
Hope it helps!
