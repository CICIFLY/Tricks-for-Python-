# Are you having troubles to install one of the popular libraries manully? 
# Or do you think it's too time consuming to install them separately?
# I recently found a way to install "Jupyter notebook, matplotlib, numpy,scipy,scikit-learn,tensorflow" on one command line.
# And it works on Linux , Windows 10 and Virtual environment too.

First, setup :  you need to have python 3 and pip3 installed 
how to install pip3 on ubuntu ? 

sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip

But before installing try to update using command

sudo apt-get update

If first did not work then you can also do this using curl

curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
python3 get-pip.py --user

Then to verify installation try

pip3 --help 

For checking version :

pip3 --version 




Here is the magic code:
pip3 install --upgrade jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn tensorflow 

Hope it helps!
